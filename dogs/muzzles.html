<h1>Muzzles</h1>

<div class="maintext">
  <p>
    We have a baskerville ultra muzzle in size 2 for our 20 lb American Hairless Terrier. It does not provide enough scavenging protection for us. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This database started off as a spreadsheet to track information while I looked for a muzzle that offered better scavenging protection, and grew because I wanted to familiarize myself with airtable. My experience with different muzzle brands and retailers is quite limited, so please do not take the inclusion of any company in this table as an endorsement from me.
  </p>
  <p>Muzzle Basics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Muzzles are a safety net that allow dogs to access needed veterinary care, exercise, and training.
    </li>
    <li>
      Muzzles can help stop dogs from eating dangerous items, and prevent bites.
    </li>
    <li>
      A well fitting basket muzzle should be comfortable and should provide the dog with enough room to open their mouth to pant.
    </li>
    <li>
      Muzzles are not a replacement for training and management, and should not be left on an unattended dog.
    </li>
    <li>
      Being able to wear a muzzle comfortably is a skill every dog should learn, if possible, so that they are prepared to wear one in emergency situations where they may be highly stressed or injured. One of my favorite muzzle training videos is <a href="https://youtu.be/1FABgZTFvHo?si=d8fi2XYAXV60KnYl"  rel="external">Teaching A Dog To Wear A Muzzle by Chirag Patel</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
