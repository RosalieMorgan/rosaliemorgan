<h1>Hello World</h1>

<div class="maintext">
  <p>
    I made this website to refresh some skills and to share a couple Airtable databases that I hope other people find useful.

      The HTML, CSS, JavaScript references are wonderfully written, with clear examples. The HTML include feature from their JavaScript library allows you to reuse blocks of HTML across pages without having to make copies of them on each page. The Spaces service provides a simple way to host and edit a simple website like this one.

      Airtable
    </dt>
    <dd>
      The interface makes creating a database simple. Sadly the filters don't work on mobile unless the desktop site is loaded or the mobile app is used. I'm running into the limits of the free tier, but it is quite generous.

      Vector ink
    </dt>
    <dd>
      A vector art program that works on Android. Unless you upgrade to the paid version, images are exported as either PNGs or JPGs with a watermark. It works well on my samsung tablet with an s-pen, but I can't help but envy all the options people have to go with their apple pencils on ipad. (I was quite disappointed to find out Adobe Illustrator Draw had been discontinued, because I saw it recommended often.)

      Shopify Policy Generators
    </dt>
    <dd>
      Shopify is an e-commerce platform, and even though I'm not selling anything, I was able to use their policy generators. They will certainly be top of mind if I ever do add a storefront.

      Amazon Web Services (AWS)
    </dt>
    <dd>
      AWS is complicated to set up, and it is difficult to get a sense of what each tool will cost after the free trial period ends, but the Cloud9 IDE is a joy to use. The IDE works from a browser without having to install anything (wonderful news if you like to use a chromebook). The VIM mode significantly reduces hand strain. The preview function works well.
   </dd>
    <dt>
      Bluehost
    </dt>
    <dd>
      A web hosting service that really wants you to use Wordpress. I was displeased with the incessant notifications to create a wordpress site, and with the built in HTML editor, but it did its primary job of hosting this site well enough.
    </dd>
    <dt>
      Google AdSense
    </dt>
    <dd>
      A way to monetize a website. I'm still working on creating enough unique content to get it approved.
